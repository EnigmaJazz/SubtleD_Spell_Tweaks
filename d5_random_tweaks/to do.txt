
/- more skins for ironskin
/ -- and immunity to stoneskin

- shield blocks skull trap?

/- SR stinking cloud: nausea should last several rounds
/ -- like, 12 seconds no attack or cast
/  --- and reduce movement
/ -- then 12 more seconds with penalties

/- improve sunfire
/ -- cast MM twice
 -- or make a different one that has 10 projectiles

/- tweak Goodberry!
 -- always make 6?  (for whole party?)
 -- only last an hour or so?
 -- no stacking (206 for same duration)
 -- heal 8+2(lvl/5) hp..?
 -- set fatigue to 1
 -- restore 1 spell of each level
 -- ...
 -- I don't love it
 -- what is the fucking use case of this spell??
- maybe simplify
 -- make it like MnG alchemy - make one of several potions
 -- convert it to an innate ability?
/- OR, just mass regenerate light wounds, non-combat only (plus reduce fatigue)

- revised magic battles
/ -- basic code
/ -- rewrite spell descriptions
 -- fix portrait icons

/- make globes of invulnerability undispellable
/ -- so Dispel and Breach are the same, not working on spell protections

/- set all cure spells to power level 11 (or 0 if that doesn't work)
/ -- ...to bypass Deflections

- make specific and combat protections dispellable, make dispellable buffs specific protections
 -- (if the dispellable buff isn't already a specific or combat protection)
 -- so Dispel and Breach affect the same group of spells

- cap dispel magic at 20th level
 -- for every spell that uses opcode 58 with param2 = 1:
 -- set param2 to 2
 -- use extend-o-matic to 50 headers, with param1 set to header min level
 -- for headers 21 through 50, set param1 to 20.

- deal with illusionary creatures/summons
